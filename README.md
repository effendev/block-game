# Block Game

This is a simple project using html, css, and js with an emphasized to javascript scripting. Originally, I want to create a snake game, like the one in [here](http://patorjk.com/games/snake/) . But since the codes in that repo is a little complex for me now, I just made a very basic block game using the combined html, css, and js knowledge I have. 

Basically, we can move the red block using up, down, left, right keys. But if by any chance our block is really close or maybe hit the wall boundary, we will get an alert notification to move the other way. 

Anyway, just clone the game, play with it a little bit, and do some pull request to add any idea to the game. Also, this isn't a done project. So, I will keep updating the game as I study more javascript.

Thank you.
